# Blockchain-Based Class Attendance Tracker

## Introduction

This Aptos smart contract provides a decentralized system for tracking class attendance. It allows teachers to easily record student attendance and maintain comprehensive attendance records.

## Vision

The goal of this project is to leverage blockchain technology to create a transparent and tamper-proof attendance tracking system. By storing attendance data on the blockchain, teachers and administrators can have confidence in the integrity of the records, while students can verify their own attendance history.

## Future Goals

- Integrate with student information systems to automatically import class rosters and student data.
- Provide attendance analytics and reporting features for teachers and school administrators.
- Enable students to view and download their own attendance records.
- Explore use cases for attendance-based incentives or rewards.
- Expand the system to support multi-teacher and multi-class scenarios.
